As for the image in this folder, it aims to give some clarity on the terms sub-columns, rows etc. For additional clarity:
In "Before editing:" UI where the generated seating is displayed, sub-columns are the vertical columns of students seated. By default
the number of such columns are five. The *five* sub-columns that are in use would irl be three columns of benches and desks, 
left, middle and right, where left and right would have two subcolumns each and the middle would just have one. The left and right 
columns also have capacity to seat 7 people in each subcolumn as opposed to the middle row which can only seat 6. This would 
total a capacity of 7+7+6+7+7= 34 students per class.
Again, refer the image to get more clarity on terms columns and sub-columns. Also, add the image to the UI for the user's ease.
